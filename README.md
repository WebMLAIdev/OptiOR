# **OptiOR – Operating Room Utilization Helper**

OptiOR is a small project that helps hospitals understand how their Operating Rooms (ORs) are being used.
You upload OR case data, the system stores it in a clean format, and then you can use it for dashboards, analysis, or even machine learning later.

Think of it as the “data backbone” for OR optimization.

---

## 🌟 What OptiOR Does

* Reads OR utilization data from CSV files
* Sends each record to a FastAPI backend
* Stores everything in a database using SQLAlchemy
* Lets you retrieve the data through simple API calls
* Designed so you can easily add analytics or ML later

It’s lightweight, clean, and easy to extend.

## 🚀 Running OptiOR

### 1️⃣ Install dependencies


pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2️⃣ Start the backend

```bash
uvicorn server:app --reload
```

Your API will be available at:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

### 3️⃣ Upload your CSV data

Just run:

```bash
python client.py
```

The script will:

* Read the CSV file in `/data`
* Clean and format the fields
* Send each row to the `/surgery-case/` API

Once the upload is done, your data is safely stored in the database.

---

## 🧱 What’s Stored in the Database?

Each OR surgery case becomes a record with:

* Date
* OR room name
* Surgeon
* Procedure
* Times, durations
* Specialty
* Case status
* And many other operational fields

This makes the data ready for dashboards, EDA, and forecasting models.

---

## 🔎 Checking Your Data

You can pull all cases with:

```
GET /surgery-cases/
```

Or visit the autogenerated docs:

```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

FastAPI gives you a clean UI to test everything.

## 💡 Why This Project Exists

Hospitals often struggle with OR under-utilization, delays, or scheduling inefficiencies.
Before you can optimize anything, you need **clean, reliable, structured data**.

That’s exactly what OptiOR provides.

This backend becomes the foundation for:

* OR utilization dashboards
* Predicting case duration
* Forecasting daily OR demand
* Optimizing schedules
* Reducing delays and overtime

---

## 📌 Future Add-Ons (Easy to Extend)

* Streamlit dashboards
* ML Ops pipelines
* Case overrun prediction
* OR demand forecasting
* Docker containerization
* Authentication & role-based access
